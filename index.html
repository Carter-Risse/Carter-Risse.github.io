            <h2>Problem Statement: Spot Finder</h2>
            <p> Many people are bored of going to the same spots repeatedly in their area and would like to branch out and discover unfamiliar places but do not know how. Familiar places or extremely foreign places are where this boredom mostly occurs. This is relevant because boredom can lead to depression, lack of motivation, and anxiety.</p>
